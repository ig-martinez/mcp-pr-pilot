    '2.  **New Documentation Files:** If the changes introduce a significant new feature, a complex workflow, or a distinct architectural component that warrants detailed explanation, suggest creating a **new markdown file** within a `/docs` directory (e.g., `/docs/my-new-feature.md`). Outline the key sections this new file should cover and provide introductory content if possible.\n'

Suggest where this diagram should be placed (e.g., in the README or a relevant `/docs` file).\n'
    '4.  **Output:** Present your findings and suggestions clearly, organized by file (README, new files). Provide concrete markdown content for updates and diagrams. If no documentation updates seem necessary based on the diff, state that explicitly. Format the entire result as a single markdown block.'
